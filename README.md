# dots

This is a repository of my (Eli Gundry) dotfiles.

## Path of the Winner

In order to install these files, you need to have:

* [yadm](https://yadm.io/)

This will manage all the config files + any programs that I generally need.

## Installation

```bash
cd ~
yadm clone https://github.com/eligundry/dots.git
yadm bootstrap
```
